    <h2>Our Coffee</h2>

    <h3>Kilimanjaro</h3>
    <p>Opening the Kilimanjaro Espresso Focus this year is a honey-processed lot. Sweet, balanced, and velvety, it is a shining example of Aida Batlle&rsquo;s work and the quintessential expression of textural coffee.</p>

    <h3>Kainamui</h3>
    <p>Who remembers that aha moment you had with your first Kenyan coffee&mdash;the bright, juice bomb acidity amplified by the mouthfeel and complexity? Kainamui, a classic example of coffee from Kirinyaga County in Kenya&rsquo;s central highlands, took us back to that first time.</p>

    <h3>Sweetshop</h3>
    <p>The idea behind our Sweetshop blend is simple: combine sweet and characterful coffee to create a fun, wildly complex and fruit-driven espresso.</p>

    <h3>Red Brick</h3>
    <p>As the crops change, so do the components of our Red Brick, highlighting harvest cycles and celebrating the seasonality of coffee. We&rsquo;ve combined the great fruit qualities from each component, and allowed the sweetness to shine.</p>

    <h3>The Filter Blend</h3>

Clean, balanced and medium-bodied; a kind, welcoming coffee to wake up to The Filter Blend offers the perfect all-day everyday brew and embodies all we love about speciality coffee. An absolute delight, you&rsquo;ll want to keep a bag in the cupboard to always have delicious coffee in the house.</p>

    <h3>Half Caff</h3>
    <p>The latest Half Caff has landed, and it combines two exciting debuts! Blending Los Acros from Jalapa, Huehuetenango, with decaf Telila from Jimma, Ethiopia, this filter is a sweet, silky sensation with notes of cherry and nougat.</p>

    <h3>Decaf Filter</h3>
    <p>When brewing our decaf filter, we recommend a similar grind size as when brewing your preferred filter coffee method. We recommend a ratio of 70g of coffee / 1L of water, for example 35g of coffee for 500g of water. Adjust to personal preference.</p>
